        """Calculates the mutual information between the probability distributions
        of the (binned) values of the time series of pairs of nodes.

        First, the mutual information is computed between each pair of
        vertices.  Then, a thresholding condition is applied to obtain
        edges.

        The results dictionary also stores the weight matrix as
        `'weights_matrix'` and the thresholded version of the weight matrix
        as `'thresholded_matrix'`.

        Parameters
        ----------

        TS (np.ndarray)
            Array consisting of :math:`L` observations from :math:`N`
            sensors.

        nbins (int)
            number of bins for the pre-processing step (to yield a discrete
            probability distribution)

        threshold_type (str)
