class PartialCorrelationInfluence(BaseReconstructor):
    """Uses average effect from a sensor to all others."""

    def fit(self, TS, index=None):
        r"""Uses the average effect of a series :math:`Z` on the correlation between
        a series :math:`X` and all other series.

        The partial correlation influence:

        .. math::

            d(X:Z) = <d(X,Y:Z)>_Y \neq X,

        where :math:`d(X,Y:Z) = \rho(X,Y) - \rho(X,Y:Z)`


        If an index is given, both terms become partial correlations:

        .. math::

            d(X,Y:Z) ≡ ρ(X,Y:M) − ρ(X,Y:M,Z)


        The results dictionary also stores the matrix of partial
        correlations as `'weights_matrix'` and the thresholded version of
        the partial correlation matrix as `'thresholded_matrix'`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        TS (np.ndarray)
            Array consisting of :math:`L` observations from :math:`N` sensors.

        index (int, array of ints, or None)
            An index variable or set of index variables, which are assumed to
            be confounders of all other variables. They are held constant when
            calculating the partial correlations. Default to None.

        threshold_type (str):
            Which thresholding function to use on the matrix of
            weights. See `netrd.utilities.threshold.py` for
            documentation. Pass additional arguments to the thresholder
            using ``**kwargs``.

        Returns
        -------

        G (nx.Graph)
            a reconstructed graph.
