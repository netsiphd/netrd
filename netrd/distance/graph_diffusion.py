        r"""The graph diffusion distance between two graphs, :math:`G` and :math:`G'`,
        is a distance measure based on the notion of flow within each graph. As
        such, this measure uses the unnormalized Laplacian matrices of both
        graphs, :math:`\mathcal{L}` and :math:`\mathcal{L}'`, and uses them to
        construct time-varying Laplacian exponential diffusion kernels,
        :math:`e^{-t\mathcal{L}}` and :math:`e^{-t\mathcal{L}'}`, by
        effectively simulating a diffusion process for :math:`t` timesteps,
        creating a column vector of node-level activity at each timestep. The
        distance :math:`d_\texttt{GDD}(G, G')` is defined as the Frobenius norm
        between the two diffusion kernels at the timestep :math:`t^{*}` where
        the two kernels are maximally different. That is, we compute the
        Frobenius norms and their differences for each timestep, and return the
        maximum difference.

        .. math::
            D_{GDD}(G,G') = \sqrt{||e^{-t^{*}\mathcal{L}}-e^{-t^{*}\mathcal{L}'}||}

        The results dictionary also stores a 2-tuple of the underlying
        adjacency matrices in `adjacency_matrices`, the Laplacian matrices in
        `laplacian_matrices`, and the output of the optimization process
        (`peak_diffusion_time` and `peak_deviation`).
