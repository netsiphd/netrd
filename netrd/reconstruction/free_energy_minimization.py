        """Infer inter-node coupling weights by minimizing a free energy over the
        data structure.

        The results dictionary also stores the weight matrix as
        `'weights_matrix'` and the thresholded version of the weight matrix
        as `'thresholded_matrix'`. For details see [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------

        TS (np.ndarray)
            Array consisting of :math:`L` observations from :math.`N`
            sensors.

        threshold_type (str)
            Which thresholding function to use on the matrix of
            weights. See `netrd.utilities.threshold.py` for
            documentation. Pass additional arguments to the thresholder
            using ``**kwargs``.

        Returns
        -------

        G (nx.Graph or nx.DiGraph)
            a reconstructed graph.
