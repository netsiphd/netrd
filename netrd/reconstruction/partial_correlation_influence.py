    def fit(self, TS, index=None):
        r"""Uses the average effect of a series :math:`Z` on the correlation between
        a series :math:`X` and all other series.

        The partial correlation influence:

        .. math::

            d(X:Z) = <d(X,Y:Z)>_Y \neq X,

        where :math:`d(X,Y:Z) = \rho(X,Y) - \rho(X,Y:Z)`


        If an index is given, both terms become partial correlations:

        .. math::

            d(X,Y:Z) ≡ ρ(X,Y:M) − ρ(X,Y:M,Z)


        The results dictionary also stores the matrix of partial
        correlations as `'weights_matrix'` and the thresholded version of
        the partial correlation matrix as `'thresholded_matrix'`.

        Parameters
        ----------

        index (int, array of ints, or None)
            Take the partial correlations of each pair of elements holding
            constant an index variable or set of index variables. If None,
            take the partial correlations of the variables holding constant
            all other variables.

        threshold_type (str):
            Which thresholding function to use on the matrix of
            weights. See `netrd.utilities.threshold.py` for
            documentation. Pass additional arguments to the thresholder
            using ``**kwargs``.

        Returns
        -------

        G (nx.Graph)
            a reconstructed graph.

Partial Correlation in Python (clone of Matlab's partialcorr)

This uses the linear regression approach to compute the partial
correlation (might be slow for a huge number of variables). The
algorithm is detailed here:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_correlation#Using_linear_regression

Taking X and Y two variables of interest and Z the matrix with all the variable minus {X, Y}, the algorithm can be summarized as

    1) perform a normal linear least-squares regression with X as the target and Z as the predictor
    2) calculate the residuals in Step #1
    3) perform a normal linear least-squares regression with Y as the target and Z as the predictor
    4) calculate the residuals in Step #3
    5) calculate the correlation coefficient between the residuals from Steps #2 and #4;

    The result is the partial correlation between X and Y while controlling for the effect of Z
