        as `'thresholded_matrix'`. For details see [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------

        index (int, array of ints, or None)
            Take the partial correlations of each pair of elements holding
            constant an index variable or set of index variables. If None,
            take the partial correlations of the variables holding constant
            all other variables.

        drop_index (bool)
            If True, drop the index variables after calculating the partial
            correlations.

        of_residuals (bool)
            If True, after calculating the partial correlations (presumably
            using a dropped index variable), recalculate the partial
            correlations between each variable, holding constant all other
            variables.

        threshold_type (str)
            Which thresholding function to use on the matrix of
            weights. See `netrd.utilities.threshold.py` for
            documentation. Pass additional arguments to the thresholder
            using ``**kwargs``.

        Returns
        -------

        G (nx.Graph)
            a reconstructed graph.

Partial Correlation in Python (clone of Matlab's partialcorr)

This uses the linear regression approach to compute the partial
correlation (might be slow for a huge number of variables). The
algorithm is detailed here:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_correlation#Using_linear_regression

Taking X and Y two variables of interest and Z the matrix with all the variable minus {X, Y},
the algorithm can be summarized as

    1) perform a normal linear least-squares regression with X as the target and Z as the predictor
    2) calculate the residuals in Step #1
    3) perform a normal linear least-squares regression with Y as the target and Z as the predictor
    4) calculate the residuals in Step #3
    5) calculate the correlation coefficient between the residuals from Steps #2 and #4;

    The result is the partial correlation between X and Y while controlling for the effect of Z
