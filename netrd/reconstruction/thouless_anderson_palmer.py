        """Infer inter-node coupling weights using a Thouless-Anderson-Palmer mean
        field approximation.

        From the paper: "Similar to naive mean field, TAP works well only
        in the regime of large sample sizes and small coupling variability.
        However, this method leads to poor inference results in the regime
        of small sample sizes and/or large coupling variability." For
        details see [1]_.

        The results dictionary also stores the weight matrix as
        `'weights_matrix'` and the thresholded version of the weight matrix
        as `'thresholded_matrix'`.

        Parameters
        ----------

        TS (np.ndarray)
            Array consisting of :math:`L` observations from :math:`N`
            sensors.

        threshold_type (str)
            Which thresholding function to use on the matrix of
            weights. See `netrd.utilities.threshold.py` for
            documentation. Pass additional arguments to the thresholder
            using ``**kwargs``.

        Returns
        -------
        G (nx.Graph or nx.DiGraph)
            a reconstructed graph.
