        Parameters
        ----------

        TS (np.ndarray)
            array consisting of :math:`L` observations from :math:`N` sensors.

        threshold_type (str)
            Which thresholding function to use on the matrix of
            weights. See `netrd.utilities.threshold.py` for
            documentation. Pass additional arguments to the thresholder
            using ``**kwargs``.

        -------
        G (nx.Graph)
            a reconstructed graph with :math:`N` nodes.
