    def dist(self, G1, G2, p=2):
        r"""The p-norm of the difference between two graph resistance matrices.

        The resistance perturbation distance changes if either graph is
        relabeled (it is not invariant under graph isomorphism), so node
        labels should be consistent between the two graphs being
        compared. The distance is not normalized.

        The resistance matrix of a graph :math:`G` is calculated as
        :math:`R = \text{diag}(L_i) 1^T + 1 \text{diag}(L_i)^T - 2L_i`,
        where :math:`L_i` is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the
        Laplacian of :math:`G`.

        The resistance perturbation distance between :math:`G_1` and
        :math:`G_2` is calculated as the :math:`p`-norm of the difference
        in their resitance matrices,

        .. math::
            d_{r(p)} = | R^{(1)} - R^{(2)} | = ( \sum_{i,j \in V} | R^{(1)}_{i,j} - R^{(2)}_{i,j} |^p )^{1/p},

        where :math:`R^{(1)}` and :math:`R^{(2)}` are the resistance
        matrices of :math:`G_1` and :math:`G_2` respectively. When :math:`p
        = \infty`, we have

        .. math::
            d_{r(\infty)} = \max_{i,j \in V} |R^{(1)}_{i,j} - R^{(2)}_{i,j}|.


        This method assumes that the input graphs are undirected; if
        directed graphs are used, it will coerce them to undirected graphs
        and emit a RuntimeWarning.

        The results dictionary also stores a 2-tuple of the underlying
        resistance matrices in the key `'resistance_matrices'`.

        Parameters
        ----------

        G1, G2 (nx.Graph)
            two networkx graphs to be compared.

        p (float or str, optional)
            :math:`p`-norm to take of the difference between the resistance
            matrices. Specify ``np.inf`` to take :math:`\infty`-norm.

        Returns
        -------
        dist (float)
            the distance between G1 and G2.
