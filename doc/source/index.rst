netrd: A library for network {reconstruction, distances, dynamics}
======================================================================

This library provides a consistent, NetworkX-based interface to various
utilities for graph distances, graph reconstruction from time series
data, and simulated dynamics on networks.

To see the library in action, visit the `netrd
explorer <https://netrdexplorer.herokuapp.com/>`__.

Installation
============

::

   git clone https://github.com/netsiphd/netrd
   cd netrd
   pip install .
