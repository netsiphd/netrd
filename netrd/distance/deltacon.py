        """DeltaCon is based on the Matsusita between matrices created from fast
        belief propagation (FBP) on graphs G1 and G2.

        Because the FBP algorithm requires a costly matrix inversion, there
        is a faster, roughly linear, algorithm that gives approximate
        results.

        Parameters
        ----------

        G1, G2 (nx.Graph)
            two networkx graphs to be compared.

        exact (bool)
            if True, use the slower but exact algorithm (DeltaCon_0)

        g (int)
            the number of groups to use in the efficient algorithm. If
            exact is set to False but g is not set, the efficient algorithm
            will still behave like the exact algorithm, since each node is
            put in its own group.

        Returns
        -------

        dist (float)
            the distance between G1 and G2.
