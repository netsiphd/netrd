class BaseDistance:
    """Base class for all distance algorithms.

    The basic usage of a distance algorithm is as follows:

    >>> dist_obj = DistanceAlgorithm()
    >>> distance = dist_obj.dist(G1, G2, <some_params>)
    >>> # or alternatively: distance = dist_obj.results['dist']

    Here, `G1` and `G2` are ``nx.Graph`` objects (or subclasses such as
    ``nx.DiGraph``). The results dictionary holds the distance value, as
    well as any other values that were computed as a side effect.
