        r"""Simulate time series on a network from the Ising-Glauber model.

        In the Ising-Glauber model, each node has a binary state. At every
        time step, nodes switch their state with certain probability. For
        inactive nodes, this probability is :math:`1 / (1 + e^{\beta (k -
        2m) / k})` where :math:`\beta` is a parameter tuning the likelihood
        of switching state, :math:`k` is degree of the node and :math:`m`
        is the number of its active neighbors; for active nodes the
        switch-state probability is :math:`1 - 1 / (1 + e^{\beta (k - 2m) /
        k})` instead.

        The results dictionary also stores the ground truth network as
        `'ground_truth'`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G (nx.Graph)
            Underlying ground-truth network of simulated time series which
            has :math:`N` nodes.

        L (int)
            Length of time series.

        init (np.ndarray)
            Length-:math:`N` 1D array of nodes' initial condition, which
            must have binary value (0 or 1).

        beta (float)
            Inverse temperature tuning the likelihood that a node switches
            its state. Default to :math:`2`.

        Returns
        -------
        TS (np.ndarray)
            :math:`N \times L` array of :math:`L` observations on :math:`N`
            nodes.
